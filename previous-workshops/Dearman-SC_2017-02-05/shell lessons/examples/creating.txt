# we can also use the shell to create our own files and folders
# in the Desktop folder
# let's create a new folder.  we will work inside of it

mkdir name

#this stands for make directory of this name

ls

# you should see you folder name in the list

# go into the folder

cd name
ls

# you should see nothing in the list.  the folder is empty
# you have created a folder
# let's see if we can create a file
# there are lots of ways to do this.  

touch filename.txt
ls

# this creates a new file
# ls should show you the file in the list

nano icecream.txt

# this opens nano and you can type inside of here 
# like you would in Word or notepad
# this is called an "editor"
# let's make a list of icecream flavors

# type an icecream falvor followed by enter
# type in a bunch of them in a list
# at the bottom of the screen you should see some 
# commands you can use inside of the editor
# ^ mean Ctl or the Cotrol Key
# hold ctl + the O key to save the file
# try that now
# to exit hit ctl + X
# there are lots of other but we wont get into that now
# do ctl O and then ctl X now
# you should ahve exited the nano

# we can make copies of files and move them to other places
# let's make a new folder called copies

mkdir copies

# and let's copy the icecreams files into this folder

cp icecream.txt copies/icecream2.txt
ls copies

# you should see the list of files inside of copies
# do you see icecream2?
# we can also move files without making a copy
# this is like when you drag files around in your file explorer

mv icecream.txt copies/icecream.txt
ls

# you should not see the icecream file listed
 ls copies

# you should see the icecream file listed

# let's copy it back to the orignal folder

cp copies/icecream.txt icecream.txt
ls

# you should see icecream
# you can also remove folders and files
# rmdir deletes directories (folders)
# rm deleted files
# let's try deleting the copies directory

rmdir copies

#did it let you or warn you?  good.  git bash doesnt usually let you delete stuff
# but UNIX bash probably will
