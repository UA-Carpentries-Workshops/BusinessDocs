## Setting up 2-FA on GitHub

2-FA, aka 2-factor authentication, will secure your account to prevent hackers gaining access to it. This is similar to how NetID + (Duo Mobile) works.

[How to setup 2-FA on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication/)

You can use Duo Mobile to setup 2-FA with GitHub.

Once you have that configured you will not be able to use your password to push to your GitHub repository. Instead of your password you need to setup a `Personal access token` under `Developer Settings` and use that.
