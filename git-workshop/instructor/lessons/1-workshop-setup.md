# Welcome to the Git Workshop (you can check-in but you can never leave)

## First
Do you have any burning questions about `git`? Maybe you have a question about how to use git in your labs or projects? Put your thoughts and questions in the `etherpad` in the QUESTIONS section. As we go along, put any new thoughts or questions in the `etherpad` in the QUESTIONS section and we will try to answer them as we go along.

## Use the stickies
Having trouble? Don't hesitate to put up your sticky and someone will be around to help.

## Desktop setup

* Open Terminal or git-bash
* Open your browser and go to the Github repo for the workshop
* You'll want to have both windows viewable at a time. On Windows use the Window-key + arrow key to snap your windows to one side or the other.

## File system setup

We need to create a folder structure where we will be doing our work.

1. In Terminal or git-bash, make sure you are in your home directory.
2. Create a folder called `use the workshop name` (`mkdir`)
3. Change directories so you are in that folder
4. Create a folder called `basic-git`
5. Change directories so you are in that folder

We will be working in the `basic-git` folder for the rest of the `basic-git lesson`.
