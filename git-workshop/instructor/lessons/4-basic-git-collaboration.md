## Remote repositories (Github)

Github provides a service for something we call a `remote repository`. A `remote repository` is a git repository that lives somewhere else in the world ... like in the cloud. Often this will be a git service provider like Github, Bitbucket, Git Lab, or Kiln, but could be a git remote repository that you setup yourself.

Github is very popular and has extra features that make collaboration easier. It is also home to pretty much every open source project ever.
