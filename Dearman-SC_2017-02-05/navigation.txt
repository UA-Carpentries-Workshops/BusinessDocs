# cd stands for change directories
# a directory is  the same a folder.  when you see a folder icon in your 
# file system explorer (finder), you are looking at a directory

cd Desktop

# this will take you to the Deskop.  You are probably familiar with all 
# the stuff you have on your Desktop.  This the big screen you see when 
# you login to you computer

# pwd stands for present working directory
# this command will tell you the "absolute" path to where you are in the 
# filesystem

pwd

# you should see something that kind of looks like something you have 
# seen before
# it looks like a ...  URL.  It looks like a way to get to a website
# That is because they are the same thing.
# URLs tell you how to get to a website and website page
# paths tell you how to get to files and directories
# pwd tells you how to get to where you are now
# If you were clicking on folders, these are the folder you would
# have to click in order to get to where you are
#  what does pwd tell you right now?  Can you get there using Windows 
# Explorer or Finder?

pwd

# this shows us the absolute path
# this is the from the starting point of the files system (the c: for 
instance)
# to where you are now

# we can also ask the shell to show us a list of files in the 
# directory where we are or other directories using the relative path

ls

# what do you see?
# do you see the same things in your file explorer?
# do you have other folders listed?  you can list the contents
# of those folders too by entering the relative path to those folder

ls foldername

# replace foldername with the name of a folder you can see when you 
# enter ls

# what do you see?
# can you go to that folder in the file explorer?  Do you see the same thing

# ls can list files in differnet ways.  You can
# ls -l to see file permissions and the last date it was changed
# try that now

ls -l

#  what do you see?  You might also see this information in your File explorer

# let's try cd again
# rember we use cd to change directories
# now that you know what directories are near you let's cd into one

cd foldernameofyourchoice

# now let's see what is in that folder

ls

# what do you see?  Is it the same as what you see in file explorer?

# let's see what the path is to where we are right now

pwd

# what do you see?  is it what you expected?

# let's go back to the desktop
# use cd to try to go there.  
#  but let's stop by the "home" directory first
# the home directory is where your computer thinks your files start.  
# it is a folder on your computer with your user name

cd ~

# to go to the home

ls

# see what is there?  Documents is in there.  Windows users will be familiar with
# that folder

# now let's go to the Desktop

cd Desktop
ls

# we see what is there
# and now we can try creating folders and files
