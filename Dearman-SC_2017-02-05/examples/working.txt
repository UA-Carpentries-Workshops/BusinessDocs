# we can use commands to see what is inside files
# cat will show us the whole file
# less will show us the contents paginated

cat icecream.txt
less icecream.txt

#these show you about the same thing because the file is so tiny
# later we will see some big files and how less can be useful

#we can see the top of a file and the bottom of a file

head icecream

# this shows you the top 10 lines of the file

tail icecream

# this shows you the bottom 10 lines of the files
# we can also specify how many lines to see

tail -n 2 icecream.txt
head -n 2 icecream.txt

# we can also do things to the content of files.  we can 
# sort the lines

sort icecream.txt

# we can count the number of lines in a files

wc icecream.txt

# we can filter the contents of a file

grep straw icecream.txt

# this will show is the lines that contain staw.
# try this with other filters

grep choc icecream.txt

# sort, wc, and grep can also be used in conjunction with ls to 
# sort, filter, or count a list of files

# I might use these together to look for a certain filename
# or see how many files I have 
# to put commands together we use the pipe symbol
# |

ls | sort

# weill see more of this later
